# WordPress Facades

Provides a set of useful wrapper classes and facades for WordPress development.

I use these often on private projects that I work on thus everything is tailored to my own needs.

Everything is heavily inspired by Laravel and the MVC pattern but I wrote all the code by myself so
you ***shouldn't*** expect to find copy-pasted code from Laravel's codebase.

Code is optimized for PHP 7.4 and I haven't tested with earlier versions. But I can confirm that I
didn't come accross any issues with PHP 8.0 as well.

If you found an issue, feel free create a PR that fixes it.
